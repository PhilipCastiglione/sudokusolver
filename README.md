# sudokusolver
A little sudoku solvin' son of a gun, written in python

I am learning how to a COMPUTER PROGRAMMER! Specifically a software (probably web) developer.
Hence, this project. Also: fun.

sudokusolver/ss_framework is eponymous and where to start if interested in looking at this program
sudokusolver/ss_solvers contains the solving logic applied to the sudoku in question

currently the program requires input from a file detailing the position and value of the starting digits
  there are several sample sudoku files prepared in the docs folder
it is planned to build and connect a simple web front end to allow a user to enter the starting grid intuitively
